# D-StarReceive
Simple D-Star reception for TTGO T-Beam ESP32 SX1278 written with Platformio

* Current version receives a short D-Star transmission and dumps it in hex format into terminal.
* It uses sx127x FSK Continuous Mode, PreambleDetect and SyncAddress on DIO0, Dclk(DIO1) and Data(DIO2)
* D-Star ending frame is caught by local configurable shift register
